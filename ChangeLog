#  Nsound is a C++ library and Python module for audio synthesis featuring
#  dynamic digital filters. Nsound lets you easily shape waveforms and write
#  to disk or plot them. Nsound aims to be as powerful as Csound but easy to
#  use.

        sample basis, note that a less than 1.0 value will really slow down the
        stream, so the name is a tiny bit missleading.
    + Added AudioStream::speedUp(float32 x); calls Buffer::speedUp() accross
        all channels
    + Added AudioStream::speedUp(Buffer x); calls Buffer::speedUp() accross
        all channels
    + Added AudioStream::subStream(float32 start_time, float32 n_seconds);
    + Added Buffer::subbuffer(uint32 start_index, uint32 n_samples)

2007-02-13 Nsound 0.3.1

    + Started using subversion
    + Extensive testing implemented in the test dir for classes:
        Buffer, AudioStream and Mixer
    + Fixed Buffer::operator-(buffer_t d, Buffer b)
    + Fixed Buffer::operator/(buffer_t d, Buffer b)
    + Fixed AudioStream::pan(buffer_t d), missing '='
    + Fixed Mixer::getStream(float32 start_time, float32
    + Removed BufferChunk::alocated_; not needed
    + Changed BUFFER_CHUNK_SIZE_ to non-const to aid in testing
    + Added AudioStream::operator=(const Buffer * rhs)
    + Added AudioStream::operator+,-,*,/(const buffer_t d, const AudioStream &
        rhs)
    + Added AudioStream::subStream(uint32 offset, uint32 n_samples);

2006-10-18 Nsound 0.3.0

    + Updated all examples with new useage and cleaned them up
    + Added Buffer::reverse()
    + Added AudioStream::reverse()
    + Code cleaned up by turning on all the g++ warnings, to use it try:
        $ scons warn=g++
    + Cleaned up and implemented operator=() and copy constructor for all
        classes
    + Added a test to SConstruct to test for the M_PI macro
    + Removed M_PI macro declaration in .cpp files
    + Class Envelope now uses an arbartary number of channels.
    + Removed any class Allocated() crap, don't need it.
    + Removed AudioStream number of channels limitation, now any number of
        channels may be stored
    + Added AudioStream::operator[+-*/](Buffer)
    + AudioStream's channel indicies now start at 0 like it should
    + Renamed AudioStream::write() to AudioStream::setChannel()
    + Renamed AudioStream::getNumberOfChannels() to AudioStream::getNChannels()
    + Added AudioStream::setNumberOfChannels(int)
    + Added Buffer Wavefile::operator<<(Buffer, std::string)
        e.g. Buffer b1 << "some_file.wav";
    + Added AudioStream Wavefile::operator<<(AudioStream, std::string)
        e.g. AudioStream as1 << "some_file.wav";
    + Rewrote Wavefile to read/write an arbartrary number of channels
        to/from a file.


2006-08-01 Nsound 0.2.2

    + Fixed and tested gnuplot usage on windows
    + Reworked scons build system a bit to check for endianess and sizeof
    + Added ACGenerateFile.py, an scons replacement for AC_SUBST()
    + Added Generator::drawParabola() for exponential curves
    + Added Generator::tanh() that will draw the tanh funciton
    + Added Generator::whiteNoise()
    + Added class LowPassFilter
    + Added example5 that simulates a drum
    + Added test_lfp that uses LowPassFilter
    + Added class ComplexNumber, not tested
    + Replaced tabs with spaces

    These don't work yet, I'm doing research:
    - Started class CascadeFilter
    - Started class LowPassFilterIIR

2006-05-01 Nsound 0.2.1

    + Added Scons (www.scons.org) build system, works on linux and windows
    + Nsound now builds natively on windows; CAUTION: windows development is
        hazardous to your health!
    + Removed a "using namespace" from Wavefile.h, shame on me!
    + Added MSVC++ project files under nsound-0.2.1/msw in hopes that it may
        be useful

2006-03-22 Nsound 0.2.0

    + Reorganized directory structure.
    + Updated configure.ac to capture CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, and CXXFLAGS correctly
    + Put everything in one namespace called Nsound.
    + Removed the NSOUND_DELETE macro from Nsound.h.
    + Moved the SWAP_BYTES macro from Nsound.h to private members of the
        Wavefile class.
    + Removed unused AudioStream.typeMatches().
    + Added AudioStream.pan() method.
    + Buffer class math operations now don't require buffers of same length,
        only operates over the shorter buffer.
    + Added -=, +=, *=, and /= operators to Buffers and AudioStreams.
    + Changed the Generator class:
        The Generator class now holds a generic waveform in a wavetable.  The
        Sine, Cosine, Triangle and Square all fill the wavetable with their
        waveform so all classes get the generate() method for free.
    + Added Triangle, Square derived from Generator.
    + Removed the Line class and implemented a drawLine method for class
        Generator.  drawLine() method takes (duration,amplitude_start,
        amplitude_finish).
    + Added a Envelope base class.
    + Reworked AdsrEnvelope to be a derived class from Envelope.
    + Updated Buffer::add(), works for all cases.
    + Updated test/test_buffer.cc to brute force test the Buffer::add() method.
    + Added examples/example4.cc to show a sine wave turn into a triange to a
        square wave.
    + Added a check in Wavefile::write() to avoid clipping.

2005-10-26 Nsound 0.1.2

    + Found and fixed bug in Buffer::operator<<(Buffer)
    + Replaced legacy NsoundSystem::LinkList class with std::vector
    + Added example3.cc
