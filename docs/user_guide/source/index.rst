Nsound User's Guide
###################

.. warning::

   This "User's Guide" is still a work in progress; some of the material
   is not organized, and several aspects of Nsound are not yet covered in
   sufficient detail.

This guide is intended as an introductory overview of Nsound and
explains how to install and make use of the most important features of
Nsound. For detailed reference documentation of the functions and
classes contained in the package, see the Doxygen documentation from
`weegreenblobbie.come/nsound <https://weegreenblobbie.com/nsound/doxygen/index.html>`__
.

.. Note::

   Nsound is open source software, the developers continually work on improving
   the library and documentation and encourage others interested to contribute.
   For information on how to do so, please contact Nick Hilton at
   weegreenblobbie2_gmail_com. Thanks!
